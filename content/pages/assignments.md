*   There will be a weekly one-page assignment, 10 assignments in total.
*   You may skip any one problem, or we will ignore the problem with the lowest grade. If you volunteered to scribe twice, we will ignore the lowest two grades.
*   The answers must be typeset in LaTeX. The answers **must** fit in one page, or your solution will not be read. Use at least 10 pt font and 1 inch margins. This rule is meant to prepare you for writing research publications: one often has to explain great ideas in a very limited number of pages.
*   Submissions must be made online and consist of a compiled PDF document.
*   Grades and comments will be posted online.
*   Solutions do not need to include all calculations, trivial details etc. Just prove to us that you found the solution, and you understand it well.
*   Problems will be graded on a 0-2 scale:
    *   **0 =** You didn't get it. Filling one page to the brim does not mean you can't get zero. Please don't write stuff you know is wrong.
    *   **1 =** Your solution was ultimately a good one, but the write-up contained significant errors or omissions.
    *   **2 =** (We think) you got it.
